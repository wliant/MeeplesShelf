# MeeplesShelf — Feature Gap Analysis

## Application Goal

MeeplesShelf is a self-hosted web application for a household or gaming group to catalogue
their board game collection and record competitive play sessions with detailed, game-specific
scoring. Its core value is reducing the friction of tracking "who played what, when, and by
how much they won" while supporting the wide variety of scoring mechanics found in modern
board games — all without relying on a third-party service.

---

## Current State

The application covers the essential record-keeping loop: add games with custom scoring
rules, log sessions with per-player scores, and view history. Access is split between a
read-only Guest mode and an Admin mode protected by a single shared password.

| Area | What exists today |
|---|---|
| Authentication | Single shared password → 24-hour JWT; Admin (full write) or Guest (read-only) |
| Game Inventory | Create / edit / delete games; 5 scoring-field types; add / remove named expansions |
| Sessions | Create / delete sessions; multi-player score entry; automatic winner calculation |
| Players | Global name registry; players created on-the-fly during session entry |
| Seed Data | 4 pre-configured games: Five Tribes, Dominion, Catan, War Chest |
| REST API | 18 endpoints (6 public read, 12 admin-protected write) |
| Deployment | Single Docker Compose stack (React + FastAPI + PostgreSQL) |

**Summary.** The app is a functional MVP. It handles the primary use-case well but is missing
the analytical layer that makes a tracker genuinely useful over time, lacks basic safeguards
(data export, session editing), has performance concerns at scale, and contains a
half-implemented feature (expansion scoring patches). Beyond the core loop, none of the
discovery, enrichment, or intelligence features that would differentiate the product from a
spreadsheet have been built.

---

## Target State

A self-hosted board game tracking platform that:

- Provides meaningful insights into play history, player performance, and game preferences
- Minimises manual effort through smart defaults, correctable entries, and (eventually) AI-assisted scoring
- Remains performant and navigable as collections and session histories grow over years
- Protects user data through export and backup mechanisms
- Supports natural household/group workflows — individual player profiles, multiple admins
- Optionally integrates with the wider board game community via BoardGameGeek

## Feature Gaps

### ~~Gap 1 — Expansion Scoring Patches~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. `merge_scoring_spec()` added to both backend (`app/app/services/scoring.py`)
and frontend (`web/src/utils/scoring.ts`). The `create_session()` route now merges active expansion
patches into the scoring spec before calculating totals. The `SessionForm` component includes
expansion checkboxes and computes an effective spec for live score preview. Expansion IDs are
validated against the game (HTTP 400 if mismatched). Covered by backend unit tests
(`app/tests/test_scoring.py`), frontend unit tests (`web/src/utils/scoring.test.ts`), and e2e
integration tests (`e2e-test/tests/test_expansion_scoring.py`).

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — sessions logged with scoring expansions will have incorrect totals, silently undermining data accuracy |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — the data model is already in place; change is limited to merging active expansion patches into the spec before calling `calculate_total()`, and mirroring the same logic in the TypeScript client |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P0~~ Done |

---

### ~~Gap 2 — Session Editing~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. `PUT /api/sessions/{session_id}` endpoint added to the backend
(`app/app/routers/sessions.py`) with `GameSessionUpdate` schema (`app/app/schemas/session.py`).
The endpoint replaces players, scores, and expansions while recalculating totals and winners.
The game is immutable on edit. The frontend `SessionForm` component (`web/src/components/sessions/SessionForm.tsx`)
now supports an edit mode via an `editSession` prop, pre-populating all fields. `SessionDetail`
(`web/src/components/sessions/SessionDetail.tsx`) has an "Edit" button for admins. `SessionsPage`
(`web/src/pages/SessionsPage.tsx`) wires the detail → edit → save flow. Covered by 7 E2E
integration tests (`e2e-test/tests/test_session_edit.py`).

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | High — entry mistakes are inevitable; forcing delete-and-recreate discourages accurate record-keeping and erodes trust in historical data |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium — requires a new `PUT` route that recalculates totals and winners, and pre-populating the existing `SessionForm` component for editing |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P0~~ Done |

---

### Gap 3 — Statistics and Analytics

**Description.** No aggregated statistics are available anywhere in the application. Users
cannot see win rates per player, most-played games, score trends over time, head-to-head
records, average session duration, or any other derived insight. The raw session data exists
in the database but is never surfaced analytically.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | High — the primary long-term value of a play tracker is answering "who is actually better at Catan?" and "what do we play most?"; without this, the app is a log with no payoff |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium — new `/api/stats` endpoints using SQL aggregations (window functions, GROUP BY); chart rendering in the frontend (e.g. Recharts); a dedicated Stats page or dashboard section |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | Sufficient accumulated session history for stats to be meaningful; Session Editing (Gap 2) to ensure data is accurate before surfacing it |
| **Suggested Priority** | P1 |

---

### ~~Gap 4 — Search and Filtering~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. `GET /api/games` now accepts an optional `name` query parameter for
case-insensitive substring matching. `GET /api/sessions` now accepts `player_id`, `date_from`,
and `date_to` query parameters in addition to the existing `game_id`. The `InventoryPage` has
a search bar that filters games client-side by name using `filterGamesByName()` from
`web/src/utils/filters.ts`. The `SessionsPage` has a filter bar with game dropdown (server-side),
date range pickers (server-side), player name search (client-side via `filterSessionsByPlayerName()`),
and a Clear Filters button. Both pages show contextual empty-state messages when filters match
nothing. Covered by frontend unit tests (`web/src/utils/filters.test.ts`) and e2e integration
tests (`e2e-test/tests/test_search_filter.py`). Files changed: `app/app/routers/games.py`,
`app/app/routers/sessions.py`, `web/src/api/sessions.ts`, `web/src/utils/filters.ts`,
`web/src/pages/InventoryPage.tsx`, `web/src/pages/SessionsPage.tsx`.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — a collection of 30+ games or 100+ sessions becomes unwieldy to navigate without filtering |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — add optional query parameters (`name`, `game_id`, `player_id`, date range) to `GET /api/games` and `GET /api/sessions`; add a filter/search bar to `InventoryPage` and `SessionsPage` |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P1~~ Done |

---

### ~~Gap 5 — Pagination~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. `GET /api/games` and `GET /api/sessions` now accept `skip` (default 0, min 0) and
`limit` (default 20, min 1, max 100) query parameters. Both endpoints return a `PaginatedResponse` wrapper
(`{ items, total, skip, limit }`) instead of a bare array. A shared `PaginatedResponse` Pydantic schema
(`app/app/schemas/pagination.py`) and TypeScript type (`web/src/types/pagination.ts`) support the generic
wrapper. The `InventoryPage` uses server-side name filtering with a 300ms debounce and an MUI `Pagination`
component. The `SessionsPage` passes pagination params alongside existing filters and resets to page 0 on
filter changes; `SessionList` includes MUI `TablePagination`. Player name search on sessions remains
client-side within the current page. Covered by E2E integration tests (`e2e-test/tests/test_pagination.py`,
13 tests) and updated existing filter tests (`e2e-test/tests/test_search_filter.py`). Files changed:
`app/app/schemas/pagination.py`, `app/app/routers/games.py`, `app/app/routers/sessions.py`,
`web/src/types/pagination.ts`, `web/src/api/games.ts`, `web/src/api/sessions.ts`,
`web/src/pages/InventoryPage.tsx`, `web/src/pages/SessionsPage.tsx`,
`web/src/components/sessions/SessionList.tsx`.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — performance degrades noticeably at scale; the problem grows silently over time |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — SQLAlchemy `offset`/`limit` on list queries; return `total` count alongside results; implement page controls or infinite scroll in the frontend |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | Search and Filtering (Gap 4) should be implemented together or after, as pagination and filtering are typically designed as a unit |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P1~~ Done |

---

### ~~Gap 6 — Data Export and Backup~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. Two admin-only export endpoints added: `GET /api/export` returns a full JSON
backup of all games (with expansions), players, and sessions (with scores) wrapped in a `FullExport`
schema with metadata (timestamp, version). `GET /api/export/sessions/csv` returns a flattened CSV with
one row per session-player, suitable for spreadsheet analysis. Both endpoints set `Content-Disposition`
attachment headers with dated filenames. The frontend `AppShell` nav bar includes an admin-only download
icon button with a dropdown menu offering "Export JSON (Full Backup)" and "Export Sessions CSV" options,
with loading state and snackbar feedback. Backend: `app/app/schemas/export.py`, `app/app/routers/export.py`,
`app/app/main.py`. Frontend: `web/src/api/export.ts`, `web/src/utils/download.ts`,
`web/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`. Covered by 12 E2E integration tests
(`e2e-test/tests/test_export.py`).

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | High — data loss from a failed Docker volume is unrecoverable; export is also needed for sharing history (spreadsheet analysis, archival) |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low-Medium — `GET /api/export` endpoints returning JSON (full fidelity) and optionally CSV (sessions and scores); a download button in the frontend settings or admin panel |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P1~~ Done |

---

### Gap 7 — Per-Player Profile and Statistics

**Description.** Players exist only as names in a global registry. There is no player
profile page, no view of a specific player's game history, win rate across different games,
score progression over time, or head-to-head record against other players.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — individual stats create engagement and friendly competition; groups often care about "who is the best Catan player" as much as aggregate history |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium — new `PlayerPage` route; `GET /api/players/{id}/stats` endpoint aggregating wins, games played, average scores per game; charts reusing Stats infrastructure |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | Statistics infrastructure (Gap 3) |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |

---

### Gap 8 — Game Ratings and Personal Notes

**Description.** Games in the inventory have no qualitative metadata beyond the scoring
spec. There is no way to record how much the group enjoys a game, leave impressions after
play, or tag a game as "we should play this again soon." This limits the usefulness of the
inventory as a decision-support tool when choosing what to play next.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Low-Medium — improves the inventory page from a pure catalogue into a living reference for the group's taste |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — add a `rating` (numeric 1–10) and `notes` (text) column to the `games` table via an Alembic migration; surface a star/number rating widget and notes field in `GameCard` and `GameForm` |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |

---

### Gap 9 — Tags and Categories

**Description.** There is no way to classify games by genre, weight, theme, estimated play
time, or any other attribute. The inventory is a flat, unsorted list. Browsing a diverse
collection for a quick game, a heavyweight euro, or a specific theme is impossible without
external references.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — tags become the primary navigation mechanism once a collection grows beyond casual recall |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium — new `tags` table; `game_tags` M:M junction; tag management UI in `GameForm`; tag-based filter chips in `InventoryPage` |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | Search and Filtering (Gap 4) for the filter UI pattern |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |

---

### Gap 10 — Game Cover Images

**Description.** Game cards display only text (name, player count, scoring field count).
There are no thumbnails or cover art. For households with large collections, visual
recognition of game box art significantly speeds up browsing and makes the inventory feel
like a real shelf rather than a database table.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — visual identity improves usability and emotional engagement with the app |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium — file upload endpoint (`POST /api/games/{id}/image`); store images on a mounted Docker volume; serve via a static file route; display in `GameCard` with an `<img>` element and fallback placeholder |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None; can be implemented independently before BoardGameGeek integration |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |

---

### Gap 11 — BoardGameGeek (BGG) Integration

**Description.** All game metadata (name, player counts, scoring spec) must be entered
manually. BoardGameGeek's public XML API (BGGAPI2) provides rich game data including
canonical names, player counts, descriptions, and cover art for virtually every published
board game. Integrating with BGG would dramatically reduce setup time for new games.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium-High — manual game setup is the highest-friction part of onboarding; a BGG search-and-import flow would reduce it to a few clicks for supported games |
| **Technical Complexity** | High — BGG XML API integration in the backend; name search + game lookup; mapping BGG fields to internal schema; image download and storage; scoring spec still requires manual configuration (BGG has no machine-readable scoring rules) |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | Game Cover Images (Gap 10) for the image display component |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |

---

### Gap 12 — Multiple Admin Accounts ~~(Will Not Do)~~

**Description.** The current authentication model uses a single shared password for all
admins. Multiple household members who want to manage the collection share one credential,
and there is no audit trail for who created or deleted records. The model does not support
revocation of a single person's access without changing the password for everyone.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — acceptable for a small household with a single admin, but becomes a liability in larger groups or when someone should no longer have write access |
| **Technical Complexity** | High — requires a `users` table, per-user password hashing, per-user JWT subjects, a user management UI, and a migration strategy for existing records (assign them to a default system user) |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None architecturally, but this is a breaking change to the auth model and should be planned carefully |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P3~~ — Will Not Do |

---

### Gap 13 — Progressive Web App (PWA) and Offline Support ~~(Will Not Do)~~

**Description.** Sessions are typically logged at a table where phones and tablets may have
unreliable WiFi. The app requires a live API connection; there is no offline mode, no
service worker, and no local caching. Users who lose connectivity mid-session cannot save
their scores without re-entering them once the connection is restored.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — a high quality-of-life improvement for the typical game-night scenario; removes the dependency on home network reliability |
| **Technical Complexity** | High — Vite PWA plugin for service worker; IndexedDB for local session draft storage; background sync when connection is restored; conflict resolution for cases where the same data is modified online and offline |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None, but implementation scope is significant |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P3~~ — Will Not Do |

---

### Gap 14 — AI Image-Based Scoring

**Description.** Already specified in `specs/future/image-scoring.md`. Users photograph the
physical game board at end-of-game and an AI vision model analyzes the board state to
automatically populate score fields. Users review and adjust before saving. This would
significantly reduce the manual data entry burden for visually rich games like Catan and
Five Tribes.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | High — eliminates the most tedious part of session logging; a meaningful differentiator that no general-purpose tracker offers |
| **Technical Complexity** | Very High — image upload pipeline; AI vision API integration (OpenAI Vision or similar); game-aware prompt construction from `scoring_spec`; confidence scoring and partial-result handling; review/correction UX |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | Session Editing (Gap 2) — users must be able to correct AI-computed scores before or after saving; Game Cover Images (Gap 10) infra for file handling patterns |
| **Suggested Priority** | P3 — foundational gaps (P0/P1) should be closed first to ensure the data layer is solid |

---

### ~~Gap 15 — No Delete Confirmation Dialogs~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. A reusable `ConfirmDialog` component (`web/src/components/common/ConfirmDialog.tsx`)
is now shown before all destructive operations. Game deletion warns about cascade-deleted expansions and
sessions. Session deletion identifies the game and date. Expansion deletion identifies the expansion and
parent game. The confirm button is red (`color="error"`). Message-building logic is extracted into pure
helper functions (`buildGameDeleteMessage`, `buildSessionDeleteMessage`, `buildExpansionDeleteMessage`)
covered by frontend unit tests (`web/src/components/common/ConfirmDialog.test.ts`). Wired into
`InventoryPage`, `SessionsPage`, and `ExpansionList`. `GameCard`/`GameList` and `SessionList` prop
signatures updated to pass full objects instead of bare IDs.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | High — accidental deletion of a game wipes its entire session history irreversibly; users learn to distrust the interface |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — add a standard MUI `<Dialog>` confirmation ("Delete Catan and all 12 sessions?") before calling the API |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P0~~ Done |

---

### ~~Gap 16 — No Loading States or Spinners~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. `InventoryPage` and `SessionsPage` now show a centered `CircularProgress`
spinner while data loads on mount. All form dialogs (`GameForm`, `SessionForm`) accept a `saving`
prop that disables Cancel/Submit buttons and shows a spinner on the submit button during API calls.
`ConfirmDialog` accepts a `loading` prop that disables both buttons and shows a spinner on the
confirm button during delete operations. `ExpansionList` has its own local `saving` state for
add/delete operations. All async handlers use try/finally to ensure loading states are always
cleared. Files changed: `web/src/pages/InventoryPage.tsx`, `web/src/pages/SessionsPage.tsx`,
`web/src/components/games/GameForm.tsx`, `web/src/components/sessions/SessionForm.tsx`,
`web/src/components/common/ConfirmDialog.tsx`, `web/src/components/games/ExpansionList.tsx`.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — users double-click save buttons, assume the app is broken on slow connections, and have no confidence that their action worked |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — add a `loading` boolean to each page/form; show an MUI `<CircularProgress>` or `<Skeleton>` while loading; disable submit buttons during requests |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P1~~ Done |

---

### ~~Gap 17 — No Success/Error Feedback (Toast Notifications)~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. A `SnackbarProvider` context (`web/src/context/SnackbarContext.tsx`) wraps the
entire application in `App.tsx`, exposing a `useSnackbar()` hook with `showSnackbar(message, severity)`.
All create, update, delete, and seed operations in `InventoryPage`, `SessionsPage`, and `ExpansionList`
now show a success toast on completion and an error toast with a user-friendly message on failure.
Error messages are extracted from Axios responses via `extractErrorMessage()` (`web/src/utils/errors.ts`),
which handles FastAPI string details, validation error arrays, and generic `Error` instances. The snackbar
uses MUI `Alert` (filled variant) with auto-hide after 4 seconds, anchored bottom-center. Covered by
frontend unit tests (`web/src/utils/errors.test.ts`).

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | High — silent failures mean corrupted or lost data goes unnoticed; users cannot distinguish success from failure |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — add a global MUI `<Snackbar>` provider with success/error variants; fire it after every create/update/delete operation |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P1~~ Done |

---

### ~~Gap 18 — Mobile Navigation Bar Overflow~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. `AppShell.tsx` now uses `useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down("sm"))` to
detect viewports below 600px. On mobile, the inline nav items are replaced with a hamburger
`IconButton` (`MenuIcon`) that opens a right-anchored temporary `Drawer` (width 260px). The drawer
contains: role chip (Admin/Guest) at top, navigation items (Inventory with `SportsEsportsIcon`,
Sessions with `HistoryIcon`), export options (admin only, with `FileDownloadIcon` and loading state),
and Logout (`LogoutIcon`). Clicking any nav item closes the drawer and navigates. The desktop layout
(≥ 600px) is unchanged. All existing functionality (export with loading/snackbar, auth-based
visibility) is preserved. File changed: `web/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | High — game night scoring is a primary mobile use case; the app is effectively broken on phones |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium — replace the inline link layout with a hamburger menu (`<Drawer>`) on small screens, or use MUI responsive AppBar patterns with `useMediaQuery` |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P1~~ Done |

---

### ~~Gap 19 — Sessions Table Not Responsive~~ (Done)

**Status.** Implemented. `SessionList.tsx` now uses `useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down("sm"))` to
conditionally render a card-based layout on viewports below 600px. A new `SessionCard` component
(`web/src/components/sessions/SessionCard.tsx`) displays each session as an MUI `Card` with
`CardActionArea` (click opens detail modal) showing the game name, date, player chips (winners
highlighted with `color="primary"`), and an explicit winner line. Admin users see a delete
`IconButton` in `CardActions`, naturally isolated from the card click area. On desktop (≥ 600px),
the existing table layout is unchanged. Both layouts share a `Paper` wrapper and `TablePagination`.
Files changed: `web/src/components/sessions/SessionCard.tsx` (new),
`web/src/components/sessions/SessionList.tsx`.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — session history is unreadable on mobile; delete is inaccessible |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium — either switch to a card-based layout on small screens, add visible horizontal scroll indicators, or use a responsive table pattern that stacks columns vertically |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | ~~P1~~ Done |

---

### Gap 20 — No Accessibility (a11y) Support

**Description.** Icon buttons (edit, delete, expand) have no `aria-label` attributes — screen
readers announce them as unlabelled buttons. There is no skip-to-content link, no landmark
roles beyond basic semantic HTML, no visible focus indicators beyond browser defaults, and
no keyboard navigation shortcuts. The delete and edit icons are visually ambiguous without
hover tooltips.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — the app is inaccessible to users relying on assistive technology; icon-only buttons are also confusing for sighted users unfamiliar with the icons |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low-Medium — add `aria-label` to all `<IconButton>` components; add `<Tooltip>` wrappers for icon buttons; add a skip-to-content link; verify focus management in dialogs |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |

---

### Gap 21 — Player Management (Rename / Delete)

**Description.** Players can be created on-the-fly during session entry, but there is no UI
or API to rename or delete a player. A misspelled name (e.g., "Alic" instead of "Alice")
stays forever and pollutes the autocomplete. There is no `GET /api/players/{id}`,
`PUT /api/players/{id}`, or `DELETE /api/players/{id}` endpoint, and no player management
page in the frontend.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — typos accumulate over time; duplicate or stale player names clutter the session form; no way to merge two entries for the same person |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium — new API endpoints for player CRUD; a player management section (could be inline on a settings page or a dedicated route); cascade/reassign logic for sessions when a player is renamed or deleted |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | P1 |

---

### Gap 22 — Session Detail Modal Lacks Context

**Description.** The session detail modal shows only a summary table and score breakdown, but
is missing several useful details: which expansions were used (chips exist in code but only
render if present), the session notes (same), and no visual distinction for the winner beyond
a small "Winner" chip. There is also no way to navigate from a session detail to the
associated game's inventory card, or vice versa.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Low-Medium — the detail view is functional but feels thin; cross-navigation between games and sessions would make history exploration natural |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — add clickable game name links, render notes/expansions more prominently, visually highlight winning player rows |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |

---

### Gap 23 — Game Card Shows No Session History

**Description.** A game card in the inventory shows only its name, player range, and scoring
field count. There is no indication of how many times it has been played, when it was last
played, or who usually wins. The inventory and sessions pages are entirely disconnected — you
must mentally cross-reference them.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Medium — "what should we play tonight?" requires switching between pages and scanning; a "Last played: 3 weeks ago" line on each card would answer the question at a glance |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low-Medium — add a `session_count` and `last_played_at` to the game list API response (or a lightweight `/api/games/{id}/summary` endpoint); display on `GameCard` |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None; lighter-weight than full Statistics (Gap 3) |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |

---

### Gap 24 — Password Field Not Masked Properly

**Description.** The admin password input on the login page uses a standard `<TextField>`
with no `type="password"` — or if it does, there is no show/hide toggle. The field label
says "Admin Password" but there is no indication of what the password is for (e.g., "Enter
the shared household password"). First-time users have no guidance on what credential to
enter or how to obtain it.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Business Impact** | Low — confusing for first-time setup; no onboarding guidance |
| **Technical Complexity** | Low — add helper text explaining the shared password model; add a show/hide toggle icon; ensure `autocomplete="current-password"` for browser integration |
| **Dependencies / Prerequisites** | None |
| **Suggested Priority** | P2 |
